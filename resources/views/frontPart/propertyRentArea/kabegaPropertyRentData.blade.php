                        <p>Properties to let in Port Elizabeth’s Kabega Park area are plentiful and affordable, and as this is an older part of the city, they are generally spacious too.</p>

<p>The Baakens River runs through the south of the area, which is situated along Cape Road (R102), past the main business areas and the William Moffett Expressway and is a peaceful residential “hideaway” with a full complement of schools, shops, sports and medical facilities as well as places of worship and retirement accommodation.</p>

<p>The commute to the business and industrial areas of the city is nevertheless fairly easy via the highway network or the city bus service, so Kabega Park is a popular choice for those looking for apartments and houses to let that are not too far from their workplaces – and not too far from the beach during weekends and holidays.</p>
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
						 <div class="more">
		
	<p>	There are several shopping centres in the area, including Metlife Mall (anchored by Checkers and Food Lovers’ Market), the Metlife Village Centre, the Kabega Park Centre and the Hunter’s Retreat Centre. There is also a Makro store complex and a good variety of coffee shops, restaurants and fast food outlets, so residents don’t have to go far from home for their daily needs.</p>

<p>Renting a home in Kabega Park also gives tenants convenient access to sports facilities such as the Hunters Arena for indoor cricket, netball and soccer and the Gravity indoor trampoline centre in neighbouring Framesby, with the Londt Park Sports Club and the Port Elizabeth Golf Club being just a few minutes’ drive away down Cape Rd.</p>

<p>For those who prefer water-sports, Port Elizabeth has 13 of SA’s most beautiful beaches, offering plenty of opportunities for all kinds of surfing, sailing, skiing, swimming, diving and angling, as well as walking or cycling along the long beachfront, playing beach volleyball and shopping for local arts and crafts at Humewood.</p>

<p>Other options for weekend fun include the Boardwalk Casino and Entertainment complex in Summerstrand, which is also the location of the penguin rehab centre, or the Bay World snake park in Humewood, or the humpback dolphin trail at Pollock beach – or perhaps just stopping to admire the view while eating a meal at one of the city’s excellent beachfront restaurants.</p>

<p>Kabega Park is also popular with retirees as it offers three retirement villages – Louis Dubb, Louisa Meyburgh and Westside, as well as easy access to pharmacies and a Medicross private hospital at the entrance to the suburb on Cape Road. The Western Suburbs Bowling Club in Sunridge Park is also easily accessible.</p>

<p>Renting a home in Kabega Park is also a good option for families with young children, as it has a choice of nursery and pre-primary schools as well as the Kabega Park dual medium primary school and St Joseph’s primary. Morningside high school is five minutes’ drive away while the north campus of Nelson Mandela University is about a 25-minute drive.</p>

<p>Properties to let in the area range from modern apartments and townhouses to large free-standing homes, and rentals currently start at around R4400 a month for a two-bedroom, one-bedroom apartment. Two-bedroom townhouses generally rent for between R5000 and R6000 a month, while three or four-bedroom, two-bathroom family homes rent for between R7000 and R8000 a month.</p>

<p>The houses in Kabega Park are fairly standard, most of them with gardens and security measures such as surrounding walls, lock-up garages and alarms, although the area has a very low crime rate.
